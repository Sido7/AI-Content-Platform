# ðŸ§  AI Content Platform â€” Microservices Architecture

This repository serves as the **entry point (face repo)** for the **AI Content Platform**, a distributed microservices-based system designed to automate **content aggregation, AI-driven analysis, and personalized recommendations**.

The platform is built using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and a combination of **Redis**, **MongoDB**, and **MySQL**, emphasizing **modularity**, **scalability**, and **clean architecture**.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The **AI Content Platform** consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain.  
Together, they form a seamless pipeline that:

- ðŸ“° Fetches and aggregates articles from multiple sources  
- ðŸ¤– Summarizes and analyzes content using AI  
- ðŸ‘¤ Manages authentication, roles, and vendors  
- ðŸŽ¯ Delivers personalized recommendations  
- âš¡ Processes data asynchronously via Redis queues
