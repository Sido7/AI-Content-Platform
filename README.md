# ðŸ§  AI Content Platform â€” Microservices Architecture

This repository serves as the **entry point (face repo)** for the **AI Content Platform**, a distributed microservices-based system designed to automate **content aggregation, analysis, and publishing** using AI.

The platform is built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **modern backend technologies** like **Kafka**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, and **Cloud Workers**, emphasizing **scalability**, **modularity**, and **performance**.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The **AI Content Platform** is composed of multiple services, each responsible for a specific domain function.  
Together, they form a robust ecosystem capable of:

- ðŸ“° Fetching and aggregating articles from multiple sources  
- ðŸ¤– Summarizing and analyzing content using AI  
- ðŸ§© Managing users, vendors, and permissions  
- âš¡ Processing data asynchronously using queues and streams  
- ðŸ“¤ Exposing APIs for web and mobile clients
